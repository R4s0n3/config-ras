## Quick Setup

This repository includes a setup script to automatically install the required tools and place the configuration files in their correct locations.

To run the script, execute the following commands from the root of this repository:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x setup.sh

# Run the script
./setup.sh
```

This will handle the installation of `tmux`, `neovim`, and `ghostty` (on macOS) or `tmux` and `neovim` (on Linux), and then copy all the necessary dotfiles for you.
